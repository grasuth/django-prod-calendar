Django Production Calendar
==========================

A simple calendar for scheduling production of real things.

The key idea
------------

Say I'm building widgets, and I can only build so many per period. I need a way
to schedule making widgets so that I don't blow my capacity, and also, so I can
schedule a holiday ahead in time and not fill it with widgets to make.

Or, when I'm close to capacity for delivery on a certain date, I can increase
my prices to match demand.  This is an aspect of demand management, as
popularized by low cost airlines.

In either case, you need a firm calendar with slots in it, a default allocation
of production capacity into slots, a way to allocate slots, and an ability to
manually adjust it at will.  That's the aim of this app.

How does it work
----------------

Don't know, haven't built it yet.

Installation
------------

Soon, really soon :-)
